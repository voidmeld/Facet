CLI_HELP = """Generate the examples' shared English word data from a licensed, versioned source.

Run (from the library root):

WHY THIS EXISTS. The word game shipped six possible answers and thirty-four
accepted guesses typed into its own source. A player typing an ordinary English
word was told it was not a word, which teaches the wrong lesson about the
example and about the framework. The crossword game needs the same vocabulary at
several lengths. One generated, licensed, provenance-carrying data set serves
both, and nothing is typed by hand.

THE SOURCE IS SCOWL, and it is chosen because it is *designed* to be turned into
redistributable spelling lists: its own Copyright file grants permission to
"use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word lists, the associated
scripts, the output created from the scripts, and its documentation for any
purpose", provided the notices travel with the copies. Those notices are copied
verbatim into the generated PROVENANCE.md, which is the whole point of doing
this from a real source instead of a scrape.

WHAT IT REFUSES. Every refusal below has a reason it is not merely defensive:

  1. A source archive whose SHA-256 does not match SOURCE_SHA256. "A dictionary"
     is not a provenance claim; a specific archive is. Without the pin, a
     re-download years later silently changes what the game accepts and every
     test that asserts a word is accepted becomes a test about the internet.
  2. A generated file whose recorded hash no longer matches its content
     (`--check`). This is the half that runs with no network and no source
     archive, so a fresh clone, a gate row and the suite can all hold the claim.
  3. An empty or implausibly small output set. A filter bug that produces four
     words is otherwise a perfectly green run: the files regenerate, the hashes
     agree with themselves, and the game rejects the alphabet.
  4. A solution that is not itself an accepted guess. That combination is
     unwinnable and undetectable from either list alone.
  5. A module that would exceed the engine's Source write cap. Studio refuses a
     Source write at 200,000 characters, and the refusal is silent enough that a
     live-synced session then runs the PREVIOUS version of the module while
     every file on disk looks correct.

THE FILTERS ARE POLICY, AND THEY ARE WRITTEN DOWN. SCOWL grades every word by
how widely it is known: size 10 is the most common thousand words, 95 is
everything including the obscure. Two different jobs need two different cuts:

  * accepting a guess should be generous, because a player who types a real word
    and is refused blames the game. Sizes up to 70 give 36,601 words at lengths
    two to seven, and cover every ordinary word tried against it (crane, fjord,
    mocha, ninja, sushi, adieu).
  * choosing an answer should be conservative, because an answer nobody knows is
    not a puzzle. Sizes up to 35 give familiar words, and simple plurals and
    past tenses are dropped on top of that — "asked" and "cakes" are real words
    and poor answers.

The two example games — the five-letter word game and the crossword tile game —
share one generated English word set. Nothing here is typed by hand, and nothing
is fetched while a game is running.

## Source

| | |
|---|---|
| Name | {SOURCE_NAME} |
| Project home | {SOURCE_HOME} |
| Archive | `{SOURCE_URL}` |
| Archive SHA-256 | `{SOURCE_SHA256}` |
| `VERSION` inside the archive | `{version}` |

The generator refuses to run against an archive whose SHA-256 does not match the
pinned value, so "a dictionary" is never the provenance claim — a specific,
identified archive is.

## What was taken from it, and why

SCOWL grades every word by how widely it is known: size 10 is roughly the
thousand commonest English words, size 95 is everything including the obscure.
Two jobs want two different cuts.

**Accepted guesses** use sizes 10 through {ACCEPT_MAX_TIER} across **every dialect
SCOWL ships** — {accept_dialects} — restricted to the `-words` classes, which is what
excludes proper names, abbreviations and contractions without a second guess-filter.
Lengths {ACCEPT_MIN_LEN} through {ACCEPT_MAX_LEN} are kept, because the crossword needs
short words and the word game needs five-letter ones.

*Every* dialect, and that is deliberate. With American and pan-English alone, `axe`,
`grey`, `colour`, `theatre`, `centre`, `favour`, `litre`, `cheque`, `kerb`, `tyre` and
`pyjamas` were all refused — SCOWL files those under `british-words` and the
`variant_*` classes. A player who types `grey` and is told it is not a word blames the
game, and is right to.

{counts}

Accepting a guess is deliberately generous: a player who types a real word and is
told it is not one blames the game, and is right to.

**Answers** use sizes 10 through {SOLUTION_MAX_TIER} at five letters, from
{solution_dialects} only, minus simple plurals (a word ending in *s* whose four-letter
stem is also a word) and simple past tenses. The answer set stays on one spelling
convention on purpose: a puzzle whose answer is `colour` is unfair to half its players
and `color` to the other half, so guesses accept both and answers pick one. That leaves **{len(solutions):,}** familiar words. Choosing an
answer is deliberately conservative: an answer nobody knows is not a puzzle, and
*asked* and *cakes* are real words but poor ones.

Every answer is also an accepted guess. The generator refuses to write the files
if that is ever untrue, because a puzzle whose answer the game would reject
cannot be won and neither list can see the problem on its own.

## Transformations applied

1. Read `final/<dialect>-words.N` for each size N in the chosen range and each
   dialect listed above, decoding as ISO-8859-1 (SCOWL's own encoding). The answer
   set keeps only the American and pan-English half of what that reads.
2. Keep only entries matching `^[a-z]+$` — this drops accented forms and anything
   with an apostrophe, and it is why no capitalisation rule is needed.
3. Keep the length range named above.
4. For answers only, apply the plural and past-tense filters described above.
5. Sort, pack each length into one fixed-width string, and record a SHA-256 per
   generated file in `manifest.luau`.

## Regenerating

```sh
python3 tools/build_word_lists.py            # generate (downloads the archive once)
python3 tools/build_word_lists.py --check    # verify the checked-in files; no network
```

`--check` is the half that runs anywhere: it re-hashes the generated files
against `manifest.luau` and needs neither the archive nor a network. The suite
runs the same comparison, so hand-edited word data fails a test rather than
quietly changing what the games accept.

## Required notices

SCOWL's licence grants permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell the
word lists and *the output created from the scripts* — provided the notices
travel with the copies. They are reproduced here in full, verbatim from the
archive's own `Copyright` file.
